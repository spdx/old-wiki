## Goals & Assumptions

This team has been formed to review current website content and
navigation with an eye towards readiness for SPDX specification GA.

Based on initial feedback, the team is currently focused on a top-down
view, with an emphasis on new visitors.

We've also asked individual work teams to take a first pass at
consolidating their Participation wikis.

The team will use a sandbox web-site to test out ideas asking for
feedback from the broader group as we go.
