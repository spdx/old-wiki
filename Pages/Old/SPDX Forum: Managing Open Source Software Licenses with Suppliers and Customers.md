The SPDX Forum is a one-day forum that will help companies learn how to
streamline their open source license compliance processes. The forum
will bring together procurement, supply chain, legal and technical staff
at companies that use open source technologies in their products to
discuss challenges and best practices for complying with open source
licenses across the software supply chain.

We will also discuss how the SPDX(TM) (Software Package Data Exchange)
standard, developed by a workgroup of the Linux Foundation, can help
companies to improve and streamline compliance efforts.

Topics covered will include:

  - State of open source compliance
  - Discussion groups on challenges and best practices for open source
    compliance
  - How SPDX can help
