Mockups for additioinal pages you navigate to by the big buttons won't
be done until we have some initial feedback on these mockups.

2011-05-12: Reviewed mockups with Biz Team. Great discussion, lots of
input. Decided that best approach going forward will be to use a sandbox
website to test out ideas so that folks can actually navigate links and
explore.

Sandbox can be found here: <http://sandbox.spdx.org/>
