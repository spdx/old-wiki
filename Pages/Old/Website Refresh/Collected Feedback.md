  - Navigation
  - Technology

## Information Architecture

  - Hard to figure out who, what, when
  - Not organized for different users
  - Proposed usage categories: Participate, Learn, Use
  - Mockup feedback/question: Where does LEARN button take you?
      - Perhaps to About SPDX?
      - Learn sub-topics should include: History, Overview, Using the
        spec, 3 minute webinar
  - Mockup feedback/question: Developing the Spec link: where does this
    take you?
      - Perhaps this link is replaced by Participation link/button.
  - Mockup feedback/question: Outreach support link: what should be
    here? Who's the user?
  - Mockup feedback/question: Where does PARTICIPATE button take you?
      - To Participation pages
  - Mockup feedback/question: Provide one-to-one mapping of big buttons
    to top level links
  - build for both business user and engineer
  - identify types of tasks
  - buttons for returning users

## Visual

  - too much text
  - add graphics, perhaps recorded video
  - need big buttons to draw attention to main areas/flow
  - reformat existing blue bar to have more links and bigger text
  - Compare what we're doing with other sites
      - Focus on Linux Foundation site rather than doing a lot of
        research across many sites since LF is sponsor

## Navigation

  - drop down menus (navigable) for top buttons allow users to learn
    more about what's available without having to navigate to another
    section first
  - provide multiple navigation paths to same content

## Technology

  - Suggest wiki be used for collaboration pages but not other pages
  - Stick with Linux Foundation technology and standards
  - What permissions control is appropriate for working areas?
