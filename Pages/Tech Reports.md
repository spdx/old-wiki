## Program Overview

The objective of the SPDX Report program is to create a repository of
articles to capture and share community knowledge about everything and
anything SPDX. This knowledge base covers a diverse collection of topics
including (but not limited to): technical issues, best practices,
relevant legal topics, tool proposals, adoption strategies and analysis,
license compliance considerations, position papers and so forth.
Periodically one of the SPDX working groups may select an article for
publication on the SPDX website (spdx.org).

    format, it will be reviewed in its entirety by at least two
    reviewers. It will either be accepted or sent back to the author(s)

    formally accepted by both reviewers, rejected by at least one
    reviewer or withdrawn by the author(s).
6.  Once a report is accepted for publication:
      - The report will be assigned a unique tech report number (e.g.,
        SPDX TR 2013-004)
      - Formatted using the standard SPDX tech report template
      - Entered into the SPDX tech report database
      - Announcement is made to the SPDX general list about the reports
