<strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Software Products Data Exchange (SPDX) maintains a list of standard licenses commonly used in open source software. This document describes various methods of accessing the current and previous versions of the list. Several methods of accessing the license list are provided ranging from simply reading the license list on the website to programmatically accessing the license list information online. This document is organized from the easiest method of access targeted at more casual users to the most sophisticated access targeted at software programmers. This document does not go into any details on how to submit new licenses or suggest changes to existing licenses. Information on the license list process and additional information on SPDX licenses can be found at <a href="http://spdx.org/spdx-license-list">http://spdx.org/spdx-license-list</a>.</p>

<strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this document is to provide a high-level view of the features targeted for v2.0 of the SPDX specification and to provide a mapping of use cases to features. Certain terminology in the document is taken from the Scrum software development methodology. Scrum is a form of agile software development. The use of the term Epic is one such example. An Agile Epic is a group of related user stories. A User story is an independent, testable requirement.</p>
