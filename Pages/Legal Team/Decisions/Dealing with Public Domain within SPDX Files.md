The SPDX Legal Team is asked from time to time to add a standard entry
on the [SPDX License List](http://spdx.org/licenses/) for content that
claims to have been placed in the “Public Domain.” We have concluded
that such a blanket determination on this subject does not comport with
the purpose or role of SPDX or the SPDX License List, for the following
reasons:

1.  SPDX seeks to simply organize and communicate information, not make
    legal conclusions. Any legal judgments required when dealing with
    open source – regarding ownership, infringement, compliance, breach,
    etc. – are necessarily left to individual users and their legal
    counsel.
2.  “Public Domain” is a concept distinct from copyright licensing; it
    generally means that the work no longer has any copyright protection
    or ownership, and therefore requires no license permission in order
    to use, copy, modify, distribute, perform, display, etc. In the
    United States – and many jurisdictions – copyright protections
    attach automatically to creative works upon creation if they satisfy
    certain minimum criteria. “Public Domain” would thus represent a
    significant change to the legal status of the work.
3.  The rules around “Public Domain” often vary or are unspecified
    jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Adding to the confusion, some
    jurisdictions may not even recognize the concept of “Public Domain”
    (or similar). As such, a license may nevertheless be required or
    implied in these cases. Even in the U.S., there is no clear,
    officially-sanctioned procedure for affirmatively placing
    copyright-eligible works into the “Public Domain” aside from natural
    statutory expiration of copyright. The bottom-line is, there are few
    if any objective, brightline rules for proactively placing
    copyright-eligible works into the Public Domain that we can broadly
    rely on.
4.  As a result of this lack of uniformity, attempts to make Public
    Domain grants are at this time largely ad hoc, and vary widely in
    approach. They range from simple statements (“this work is hereby
    placed in the Public Domain”) to extensive claims about signed
    affidavits from all contributors disclaiming ownership over their
    work. More confusingly, some supposed “Public Domain” grants are
    actually worded like licenses, and appear to retain rights and grant
    permissions. In other words, it is difficult for third parties and
    downstream recipients to really know if – and to what extent – such
    claims over the change in legal status of a work are valid,
    enforceable, revocable, etc., and making such determinations is
    largely a legal judgment call.
5.  Having a generic identifier with no corresponding license text to
    match to places the burden on the SPDX user to make a legal
    interpretation to determine whether the software is indeed public
    domain. The goal of the SPDX License List is to avoid such
    interpretations, but to provide a list of vetted short identifiers
    and license text than can be definitively matched, whether by using
    the efficiency of automated processes (i.e. scanning tools, etc.) or
    human eyes.

Due to the foregoing reasons, the SPDX Legal Team will continue to treat
each unique “Public Domain dedication” in the same way as any license is
treated in the standard. We believe this is the safest, common
assumption that can be made regarding this type of material. Some
commonly used “Public Domain dedications” have already been included in
the SPDX License List (e.g., ANTLR, Sax, CC-0), and others may be added
to the List using the Process for Requesting New Licenses be Added.
"Public Domain dedications" that are not on the SPDX License List will
be treated as would a license not found on the SPDX License List via a
license reference (see section 5, "Other Licensing Information
Detected," of the Spec).
