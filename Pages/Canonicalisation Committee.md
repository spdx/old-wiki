The Canonicalisation Committee is a group within SPDX dedicated to
creating a canonical serialisation format for the upcoming SPDX 3.0
specification, enabling SPDX data to be shared and combined whilst
ensuring data integrity.

There are several key opportunities for SPDX 3.0: the ability to verify
the integrity of individual Elements independent of a containing
document, multiple equivalent serialisation formats capable of
round-trip conversion, and a clearly demarcated split between SPDX's
information model and data models.

All of these opportunities hinge on having a canonical serialisation
format: a representation of SPDX data that is never ambiguous and is
unaffected by stylistic or platform-specific concerns. As such, the SPDX
Canonicalisation Committee will be dedicated to:

  - Writing a specification for a canonical serialisation format for
    SPDX 3.0 data.

<!-- end list -->

  - Determining processes for Element-level integrity and signing.

<!-- end list -->

  - Making recommendations to the [ SPDX Tech
    Team](Technical_Team "wikilink") about potential ambiguities found
    in the information model that might inhibit canonicalisation.

The Canonicalisation Committee's discussions are currently held on the
[SPDX Tech Team mailing list](https://lists.spdx.org/g/Spdx-tech) (send
