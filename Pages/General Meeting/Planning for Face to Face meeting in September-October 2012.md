## Introduction

The purpose of this wiki page is to host the planning information for
the SPDX f2f we are targeting to hold in the bay area in Sept/Oct 2012.
Please see the bottom of this page to indicate which dates works best
with you.

I have a number of agenda items that can easily consume a full day worth
of discussion. I divide the agenda items in two categories: Core agenda
items are the primary reason to hold this f2f meeting, and secondary
agenda items will be discussed given time availability.

## Core agenda items

For all these core items, I will have a proposal to present that will
drive the discussion. The goal of this f2f is really to have an
agreement on how to proceed with these items. The agreement on these
will enable the WG to be on a better and faster path of success and it
is critical to get to that point. Otherwise, 1) recruiting other
companies into this WG will be a mission impossible challenge (How many
new companies have joined SPDX recently?), 2) Maintaing current
participants will also be challenge if we don't have a resolution on
these items, and not to forget the 3) fading possibility of achieving
the goal of making compliance easier to achieve via SPDX standard data
exchnage format (across supply chains).

1.  Project Governance: I will propose a governance model and drive this
    discussion
2.  WG Structure: Goes with the above item as part of governance
3.  Roadmap for 2012-2013-2014: I have a proposal on setting up a
    roadmap that will initiate this discussion
4.  Charter: Mission / Goals / Vision: Continue this discussion and get
    to a closure on it.
5.  Recruitment: I have a proposal on this that covers companies to
    approach and how
6.  SPDX web site

## Secondary agenda items

These items are not the reasons we're calling for this meeting. However,
since a lot of folks are expected to attend, then it would make sense to
add 1 more day to the meeting to cover these items.

1.  Review current state of affairs for each sub-team
2.  Current challenges, what are we doing about it, and how can we do
    better
3.  Review of what needs to be done to get to SPDX 2.0 (technical, legal
    and business)
4.  2.0 Use Cases
5.  2.0 Model design

his is a working session where people driving the effort are expected to
drive the discussions. For each of the above items, it would be
fantastic if Team Leads/Chairs can prepare a presentation that covers

  - What was achieved in your team since Jan 2012?
  - What are the challenges your team is facing? Any proposal on how to
    resolve these challenges? How can other teams or the Linux
    Foundation help you with these?
  - What is on your plate for the rest of the year and well into 2013?
  - What areas you need help to get you unlocked?
  - etc.

Anyone who participated in program reviews in their companies will find
this familiar. The goal is to have a better alignment between the
various team, understand where the challenges are and identify how we
can resolve them, plan for getting 2.0 out of the door, etc.

This F2F is really the opportunity for SPDX to regroup and proceed with
a strong momentum.

## Suggested Locations

Any SPDX participant companies in the bay area who can host? Please let
us know.

  - Jack Manbeck, Washington DC area or possibly Austin Texas or Dallas
    Texas (I would need to verify availablity for all sites once we have
    the day in mind.)
  - Scott Lamons. HP would be willing to host in Fort Collins, CO. I may
    also be able to arrange a meeting room in our Austin, TX facility.

## Notes

1.  Presenters at the F2F meeting (me included): it would be very
    helpful to plan to make available your material a week before the
    meeting to allow enough time for SPDX prticipants to review and be
    ready for dicussions.
2.  I will detail the agenda items further as we approach the meeting
    dates based on how I will structure my presentations (for my part)
    and on feedback from participants on what they want to discuss.
