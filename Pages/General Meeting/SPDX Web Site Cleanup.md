The following table lists the curret issues/improvments that need to be
made to the SPDX website following our conversion thiis past month from
the old site to the new one.

The list was intiially populated by Jack Manbeck but feel free to add to
or modify the contents. Note: I found it a little challenging to add a
table to the wiki and to be able to format it. I ended up restorting to
HTML. This may make it challangeing for some to add items. If thats the
case, please feel free to post to the list and I can make the appopriate
changes or add a line after the table stating who you are and what your
feedback is.

The Assigned To and Status fields will be taken care of by the web
revamp team.

<td><p>Under <a href="http://spdx.org/about-spdx">http://spdx.org/about-spdx</a> it says: "This site is the home for everything SPDX and is the workspace for SPDX Groups." I think this should be rephrased to: "This site is the home for everything SPDX and is the workspace for the SPDX sub-groups (Legal, Technical and Business)." On that same page, sometimes we call it "SPDX Standard" and then "SPDX Specification". Are these used interchangeably? It's unclear.</p></td>

The grass-roots effort includes representatives from more than 20 organizations—software, systems and tool vendors, foundations and systems integrators—all committed to creating a standard for software package data exchange formats." Suggested: "The SPDX project is hosted at the Linux Foundation that provides a neutral environment for collaboration. The SPDX standard is developed by the participants of the project which include representatives from more than 20 organizations—software, systems and tool vendors, open source foundations and systems integrators. The SPDX participants are committed to creating a standard for software package data exchange formats."</p></td>

<td><p>Term-wise: SPDX is a Working Group of the Linux Foundation. It's Technical, Business and Legal teams are considered sub-groups. This needs to be updated through out the pages. For instance, the blue box "PARTICIPATE - Join a Working Group" need to be changed to something like "PARTICIPATE - Join a Task Force" or "PARTICIPATE - Join a Working Sub-Group" or something of that sort. (Update) I later read also that these are called teams. This needs to be updated to be consistent.</p></td>

<td><p>Under <a href="http://spdx.org/content/tutorials">http://spdx.org/content/tutorials</a> Aesthetics aside, is it possible to provide a 1-2 lines description of what the paper, webinar and spec are? For an example, visit <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/workgroup">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/workgroup</a> and scroll towards the end where we feature the SPDX paper.</p>
<p>The SPDX video is hosted on BlackDuck site. I think this should live under spdx.org. You can get a youtube or vimeo account for spdx and host videos there and embed them on the spdx.org site.</p>
<p>If I click on "Read the Spec" blue box I get transfered to <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/workgroup">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/publications/workgroup</a>. This is not a tutorial. On that new URL, there is also a mention of License List. For new reader, this is first mention. I think you may need some basic description. It feel that the site keeps throwing users from one page to another.</p></td>

<td><p>UNDER <a href="http://spdx.org/content/how-participate">http://spdx.org/content/how-participate</a><br />
<br />
<br />
How to participate?<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this pages requires an overhall in terms of reorganizing the material,<br />
<br />
<br />
1) I could not find anything at all about the project governance. How decisions are made? by whom? who drives the project? how roadmap items get decided? who does the work? is participation tied to providing resources? how to become a chair in a sub-workgroup? how to be a chair of SPDX? etc etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Participation seems to be treated differently than Contributing. This is related to item 1) above - governance.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) It feels as if this is treated as an open source project. I may be wrong. However, in all of the similar efforts I participated in for the past 12 years (at OSDL and other efforts at the LF), a standard similar to SPDX has usually two branches: the specs itself driven by committed companies who want to move the standard and get it adopted and use it, and the reference implementation which is open to anyone and everyone to participate in. Is this something you considered?<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Also under this page, it mentions the 3 sub-groups with links to the page of each of them. The pages for all 3 sub-groups are formatted in a different way with different set of info presented. (Update) Later on I discovered new pages that discuss what the teams do (totally random). <a href="http://spdx.org/content/business">http://spdx.org/content/business</a> and <a href="http://spdx.org/content/legal">http://spdx.org/content/legal</a> and <a href="http://spdx.org/content/technical">http://spdx.org/content/technical</a>.</p></td>
