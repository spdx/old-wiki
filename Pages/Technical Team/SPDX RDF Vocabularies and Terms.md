This area houses the RDF Vocabularies and Terms for each version of the
specification. If a link is not marked as Draft that means it was the
final release for that version of the SPDX Specification. Do NOT edit
those pages. The only pages which can be edited are marked as (DRAFT) in
their link. If you see a problem with a final version please contact the
Technical Team.
