1.  **Title:** Committers provides SPDX data for a code being committed
2.  **Primary Actor:** Committer
3.  **Goal in Context:** To include SPDX data for code being committed
    to an upstream project.
4.  **Stakeholders and Interests:**
    1.  **Committer:**
        1.  To communicate the licensing information for the code they
            are committing to the upstream project.
    2.  '''Upstream maintainers: '''
        1.  To be able to document the license information for the
            commits they receive
        2.  To communicate the licensing information for their
            copyrightable artifacts.
        3.  To have their licenses respected
    3.  **Consumers of upstream source:**
        1.  To receive accurate and clear information of licensing of
            upstream source
        2.  To be able to comply easily with licenses for upstream
            source
        3.  To be able to subset, extend, or aggregate artifacts and
            pass on clear authoritative verifiable license for the
            resulting new copyrightable artifacts.
5.  **Preconditions:**
    1.  Committer has decided on licensing information for their commit.
6.  **Main Success Senario:** Committer communicates accurate complete
    licensing information for their commit in an SPDX data format as
    part of the commit process.
7.  **Failed End Conditions:**
    1.  Committer communicates inaccurate licensing information for
        their commit (license in the committed file disagrees with the
        asserted information)
    2.  Committer communicates incomplete licensing information for
        their commit.
8.  **Trigger:**
    1.  Commit of code to an upstream project.
9.  **Notes:**
