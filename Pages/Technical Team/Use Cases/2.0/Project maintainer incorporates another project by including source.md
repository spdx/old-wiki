1.  **Title:** Project maintainer incorporates another project by
    including source
2.  **Primary Actor:** Member of upstream maintainer team
3.  **Goal in Context:** To include another project by including its
    source code, and reference the SPDX data from the incorporated
    project.
4.  **Stakeholders and Interests:**
    1.  '''Upstream maintainers: '''
        1.  To communicate the licensing information for their
            copyrightable artifacts including the included project.
        2.  To have their licenses respected
    2.  **Incorporated Project maintainers:**
        1.  **To have their licenses respected**
    3.  **Consumers of upstreams copyrightable artifacts:**
        1.  To receive accurate and clear information of licensing of
            artifacts
        2.  To be able to comply easily with licenses for artifacts
        3.  To be able to subset, extend, or aggregate artifacts and
            pass on clear authoritative verifiable license for the
            resulting new copyrightable artifacts.
5.  **Preconditions:**
    1.  Incorporated project maintainers have selected licenses for the
        copyrightable artifacts originating with the project (package,
        files, etc) and provided SPDX data for their source code.
    2.  Upstream has identified license data for other copyrightable
        artifacts they consume
6.  **Main Success Scenario:** Upstream communicates accurate complete
    licensing information for their copyrightable artifacts in an SPDX
    data format including the information for the incorporated project.
7.  **Failed End Condition:** Upstream communicates inaccurate
    incomplete licensing information for their copyrightable artifacts.
8.  **Trigger:**
    1.  Incorporate of another projects source code.
9.  **Notes:**
