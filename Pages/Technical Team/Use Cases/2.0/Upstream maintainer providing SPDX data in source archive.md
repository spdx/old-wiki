1.  **Title:** Upstream maintainer providing SPDX data in source archive
2.  **Primary Actor:** Member of upstream maintainer team
3.  **Goal in Context:** To include with the copyrightable artifacts
    distributed by the project SPDX data describing it's licensing
    information in the archive of its source being distributed. In
    particular this may look like an upstream maintainer including SPDX
    data in their tarball or jar file.
4.  **Stakeholders and Interests:**
    1.  '''Upstream maintainers: '''
        1.  To communicate the licensing information for their
            copyrightable artifacts.
        2.  To have their licenses respected
    2.  **Consumers of upstreams copyrightable artifacts:**
        1.  To receive accurate and clear information of licensing of
            artifacts
        2.  To be able to comply easily with licenses for artifacts
        3.  To be able to subset, extend, or aggregate artifacts and
            pass on clear authoritative verifiable license for the
            resulting new copyrightable artifacts.
5.  **Preconditions:**
    1.  Upstream has selected licenses for the copyrightable artifacts
        originating with the project (package, files, etc)
    2.  Upstream has indentified license data for other copyrightable
        artifacts they consume
6.  **Main Success Scenario:** Upstream communicates accurate complete
    licensing information for their copyrightable artifacts in an SPDX
    data format in the source archive they provide for a given release.
7.  **Failed End Condition:** Upstream communicates inaccurate
    incomplete licensing information for their copyrightable artifacts.
8.  **Trigger:**
    1.  Release of a new source archive
9.  **Notes:**
