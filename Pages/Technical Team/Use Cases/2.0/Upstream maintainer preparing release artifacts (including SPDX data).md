1.  **Title:** Upstream maintainer preparing release artifacts
    (including SPDX data).
2.  **Primary Actor:** Member of upstream maintainer team
3.  **Goal in Context:** To provide a SPDX data for a particular release
    of the copyrightable artifacts in their project packaged together
    with those release artifacts (for example, inside a source tarball,
    inside a jar, inside a binary tarball, etc).
4.  **Stakeholders and Interests:**
    1.  '''Upstream maintainers: '''
        1.  To communicate the licensing information for their
            copyrightable artifacts.
        2.  To have their licenses respected
    2.  **Consumers of upstreams copyrightable artifacts:**
        1.  To receive accurate and clear information of licensing of
            artifacts (without having to hunt around for it. You
            download the release, and the licensing data is right there
            within it)
        2.  To be able to comply easily with licenses for artifacts
        3.  To be able to subset, extend, or aggregate artifacts and
            pass on clear authoritative verifiable license for the
            resulting new copyrightable artifacts.
5.  **Preconditions:**
    1.  Upstream has selected licenses for the copyrightable artifacts
        originating with the project (package, files, etc)
    2.  Upstream has indentified license data for other copyrightable
        artifacts they consume
6.  **Main Success Scenario:** Upstream communicates accurate complete
    licensing information for their copyrightable artifacts in an SPDX
    data format together with their release artifacts (in their tarball,
    jar, etc).
7.  **Failed End Condition:** Upstream communicates inaccurate
    incomplete licensing information for their copyrightable artifacts.
8.  **Trigger:**
    1.  Project release
9.  **Notes:**
