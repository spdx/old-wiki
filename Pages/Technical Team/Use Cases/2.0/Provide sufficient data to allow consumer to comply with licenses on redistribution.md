1.  **Title:** Provide sufficient data to allow consumer to comply with
    licenses on redistribution
2.  **Primary Actor:** Consumer who would like to redistribute
3.  **Goal in Context:** To include sufficient information to allow the
    consumer to comply with licensing on redistribution. Note: We are
    not telling the consumer \*how\* to comply, just providing
    information sufficient to comply based on their interpretation of
    the licenses.
4.  **Stakeholders and Interests:**
    1.  **Consumers of copyrightable artifacts:**
        1.  To receive accurate and clear information of licensing of
            artifacts
        2.  To be able to comply easily with licenses for artifacts
        3.  To be able to subset, extend, or aggregate artifacts and
            pass on clear authoritative verifiable license for the
            resulting new copyrightable artifacts.
5.  **Preconditions:**
    1.  Consumer has a policy about how to comply with a given license,
        or the capacity to develop one.
6.  **Main Success Senario:** Consumer is able to comply with license on
    redistribution based on the SPDX data.
7.  **Failed End Condition:** Consumer is not able to comply with
    license on redistribution based on the SPDX data.
8.  **Trigger:**
    1.  Receipt of a new copyrightable artifact(s).
9.  **Notes:** Review attached example required contract clause proposed
    by Alcatel-Lucent to their suppliers. We note that SPDX 1.x model
    may not adequately support tying together licenses and required
    attributions of copyright holders, for example.
