1.  **Title:** Upstream maintainer providing SPDX data at a URL
2.  **Primary Actor:** Member of upstream maintainer team
3.  **Goal in Context:** To provide a URL at which the SPDX data for a
    particular release of the copyrightable artifacts in their project
    can be retrieved, so that the SPDX data can be simply referenced.
4.  **Stakeholders and Interests:**
    1.  '''Upstream maintainers: '''
        1.  To communicate the licensing information for their
            copyrightable artifacts.
        2.  To have their licenses respected
    2.  **Consumers of upstreams copyrightable artifacts:**
        1.  To receive accurate and clear information of licensing of
            artifacts
        2.  To be able to comply easily with licenses for artifacts
        3.  To be able to subset, extend, or aggregate artifacts and
            pass on clear authoritative verifiable license for the
            resulting new copyrightable artifacts.
5.  **Preconditions:**
    1.  Upstream has selected licenses for the copyrightable artifacts
        originating with the project (package, files, etc)
    2.  Upstream has indentified license data for other copyrightable
        artifacts they consume
6.  **Main Success Senario:** Upstream communicates accurate complete
    licensing information for their copyrightable artifacts in an SPDX
    data format at a URL.
7.  **Failed End Condition:** Upstream communicates inaccurate
    incomplete licensing information for their copyrightable artifacts.
8.  **Trigger:**
    1.  Project release
9.  **Notes:**
