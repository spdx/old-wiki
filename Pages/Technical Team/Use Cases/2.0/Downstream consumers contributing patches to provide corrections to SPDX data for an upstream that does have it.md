1.  **Title:** Downstream consumers contributing patches to provide
    corrections to SPDX data for an upstream that does have it.
2.  **Primary Actor:** Downstream Consumer
3.  **Goal in Context:** The downstream consumer would like to correct
    SPDX data in the upstream because they believe it contains an error.
4.  **Preconditions:**
    1.  Downstream consumer has analyzed upstream and assembled a
        correction to SPDX data found in the project due to what they
        discovered about it.
    2.  Downstreams correction is acceptable to upstream.
5.  **Stakeholders and Interests:**
    1.  **Downstream Consumer providing patch:**
        1.  To get upstream to incorporate their correction into
            upstreams SPDX data in their source base.
        2.  To gain legitimacy for their correction by its acceptance by
            upstream.
    2.  '''Upstream maintainers: '''
        1.  To be able to document the license information for their
            project accurately.
        2.  To have their licenses respected
    3.  **Consumers of upstream source:**
        1.  To receive accurate and clear information of licensing of
            upstream source
        2.  To be able to comply easily with licenses for upstream
            source
        3.  To be able to subset, extend, or aggregate artifacts and
            pass on clear authoritative verifiable license for the
            resulting new copyrightable artifacts.
6.  **Main Success Scenario:** Upstream accepts SPDX data correction
    from downstream as being an accurate reflection of their licensing
    information and incorporates it into their source base (and the
    conscious decision to make correction is reflected)
7.  **Failed End Condition:** Upstream does not accept SPDX data
    correction from downstream and incorporate them into their source
    base.
8.  **Trigger:**
    1.  Submission of SPDX data correction to upstream for
        incorporation.
