We have several sources to begin pulling for SPDX Use Cases:

1.  The Pad from earlier conversations collected at [Use Cases For SPDX
    2.0
    Discussion](Technical_Team/Old/Use_Cases_Collected_during_1.x_timeframe "wikilink")
2.  The old [SPDX 1.0 Use
    Cases](Technical_Team/Old/Sandbox_for_Sharing_Examples/SPDX_Use_Case_1 "wikilink")
    as well as the [SDPX 1.0 Use Case
    Picture](:File:ecosystem.jpg "wikilink").

## Use Cases

I'd like to propose that we flesh out use cases here by having a brief
summary listed here as a link to a more detailed child page. Note, these
use cases should be **doable** but in general not **required**. Any item
listed here that is not a link, should have a child page created for it.

17. Other arising during vetting...
    1.  Given 2 SPDX files about the same codebase from the same source,
        be able to tell which is the later rev / more current and
        correct one. \[DETAIL PAGE NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN - seems to be
        asking for something more robust than just a later date on one
        SPDX file vs. the other, rather 'signing with revisioning, where
        the later revision may reference the earlier and declare it is
        an amendment to the earlier one\]

## Cross-cutting concerns

1.  Provenance (the need to optionally use signing to validate who said
    what)
2.  Trust
3.  Handling staleness of data
4.  Composite licensing
5.  Ease of sharing information
    1.  Collecting tribal knowledge along the way
6.  Guarding against file bloat
7.  Simple simple simple
8.  SPDX-Lite: here's interest in something SPDX-Lite like
    <https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4516>
9.  Clarity
10. Automation/toolifiability
11. Regionality

## Themes

Looking at these Use Cases, there are some underlying themes:

1.  Root of data (closer to upstream the better)
2.  Subsetting of copyrightable things (and their SPDX data) (**Note**:
    Subsets of copyrightable things are usually also copyrightable
    things)
3.  Aggregation of copyrightable things (and their SPDX data) (**Note**:
    Aggregations of copyrightable things are usually also copyrightable
    things).
