Here are some examples generated by OpenLogic. The are comformant to the
1.0 beta version of the spec.

**Notes**

The resulting files are well-formed RDF. However the graph they produce
when parsed as RDF is total gibberish. It appears to be impossible to
create a document that both matches the current spec and produces a
meaningful RDF graph.

The OpenLogic License Analysis system uses
[SHA-256](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) to produce checksums of
files. We replaced the SHA1 tag with SHA256 to indicate this.
