# Google Summer of Code Yearly Summary

## GSOC 2014

For the first time, the Linux Foundationâ€™s SPDX Workgroup participated
in the 2014 Google Summer of Code internship program. The goal was to
engage students in open source projects, learn a bit about open source
compliance, and meet open source community members. We had excellent
engagement in our first year, with a total of four projects accepted
from three different universities. These projects helped advance SPDX by
connecting the specification with open source programming languages and
open source license scanners. They helped move SPDX into communities
that can aid and benefit from the distribution of open compliance
practices. Specific projects, and the students who worked on them
include:

**Python SPDX Parser Library** *- Ahmed Hisham Ismail at the German
University in Cairo*

**GO SPDX Parser Library** *- Vlad Velici at the University of
Southampton*

**SPDX Merge Tool** *- Alex Ling at the University of Nebraska Omaha*

**FOSSology+SPDX Tooling** *- Zachary McFarland at the University of
Nebraska Omaha.*
