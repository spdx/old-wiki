This page describes conventions that should be followed on the SPDX
wiki. You can also read the page on [getting
started](Getting_started_with_the_SPDX_wiki "wikilink").

## SubPages

This wiki uses subpages to provide a hierarchy. For example, the minutes
for the business team are located under `Business Team/Minutes`.

When you add a new page, please make sure to use the correct hierarchy.
If you want to create a new business related page, choose `Business
Team/name of page` If you'd like to add new business minutes, add them
as `Business Team/Minutes/YYYY-MM-DD`

## Categories

We use [categories](Special:Categories "wikilink") to organize pages.
You should add one of these categories at the bottom of each new page:

  - \[\[Category:Business\]\]
  - \[\[Category:General\]\]
  - \[\[Category:Legal\]\]
  - \[\[Category:Technical\]\]

## Adding minutes

The list of minutes is updated automatically but this requires minutes
to be added in the right location. Please use `XXX
Team/Minutes/YYYY-MM-DD` for new minutes.

Additionally, minutes should have the category \[\[Category:Minutes\]\]
in addition to the category defining the subject area.

## Headings

Make sure not to use a heading starting with = as this reserved for the
title of the page. Headings should start with ==. See the [MediaWiki
wiki syntax](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting) page for
more information.
