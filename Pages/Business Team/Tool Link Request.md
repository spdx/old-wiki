This wiki page describes how to submit a request to the SPDX workgroup
to have your tools which support SPDX linked to the [SPDX website under
the Tools section](http://spdx.org/tools).

**General Requirements**  
The following are the general requirements you must meet before we can
provide a link from the SPDX website to your tool and/or project:

  - The tool must currently support SPDX (i.e. it is not a planned
    release).
  - You have a page on your website that describes how the tool supports
    SPDX. This will be the link you provide in the Required Information
    below.

  
**Required Information**  
When submitting a request to have a link to your tool you must provide
the following:

  - Whether this is a community or commercial tool.
  - A small logo which can be displayed. This is optional. If provided
    it must meet the following criteria
      - Maximum file size: 32 MB
      - Allowed extensions: png gif jpg jpeg
      - Images must be between 122x122 pixels and 1000x122
  - A short teaser of one or two sentences that describes your tool. No
    more than 160 characters including spaces.
  - A long description which can be up to a couple of paragraphs. Try
    not to get too verbose. You will have a link to your website for
    lengthy explanations.
  - An http link to your site for access to the tool and information on
    how it supports SPDX.

  
**How to submit a Request**  
Send an email to the [outreach team mailing
list](mailto:spdx-biz@lists.spdx.org) with the subject Tool Link
Request. You must provide the information listed above in Required

**Review Process**

You are welcome to participate. You will also be contacted with the
result of the review. Once approved, it will be posted to the site.
