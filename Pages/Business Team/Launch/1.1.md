Press Release Content

The SPDX workgroup, hosted by The Linux Foundation, today announced the
release of version 1.1 of its Software Package Data Exchange (SPDXâ„¢)
standard.

  - Expanded license list -- 12new licenses added in the 1.1 release and
    we now have a process in place to accomodate new license requests.
  - OSI announces that is has adopted SPDX short identifiers (quote and
    pointer)
  - Based on feedback from the community the SPDX data license was
    changed from PddL to CC0. (get a quote from Karen C)
  - Summary of changes from 1.0 to 1.1. (Kate)
  - Talk about the availability of both commercial and open source tools
    that support SPDX.

A key enabler to the adoption of SPDX is tooling to automate the
production of SPDX files and we are pleased to see both commercial and
open source projects stepping up to this challenge.

Reach out to commercial vendors for quotes:

  - Antelink
  - Blackduck
  - OpenLogic
  - NexB
  - Palamida
  - Protecode

Reach out to Open Source projects for quotes:

  - UNO Fossology project (Matt Germonprez)
