Email blurb for recruiting beta sites

As you may know, SPDX is a new standard for companies that need to
exchange information about the open source licenses included in a
software package. SPDX is being developed by dozens of organizations as
a working group of the Linux Foundation. This standard will greatly
streamline the disparate disclosure processes that exist through the
software supply chain.

**We Want You**

We are looking for a few companies or organizations that would like to
participate in the SPDX Beta Program. Beta participants will be asked to
use the SPDX spec to exchange information with one of their trading
partners (a supplier or a customer/user of their software) and provide
feedback on the specification and the process.

**You Can Count on Us**

The SPDX support team will be helping you through the process –
providing you with advice and information and gathering feedback on your
experiences.

**Be an SPDX Star**

By participating in the Beta program, you can help further the SPDX
initiative – reducing the time and effort involved to understand and
analyze software for open source licenses.
