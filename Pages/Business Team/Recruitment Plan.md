## Pre-requisites - Prior to starting any recruitment into the WG

We need to have in place all the below listed items:

  - Documented governance (Jack: discussion for General meeting)
  - Documented roadmap (Jack will draft milestone roadmap)
  - Documented charter (Team feels new Mission, Vision, Execution page
    is good enough for now)
  - New presentation for recruiting purposes (Phil working with Ibrahim)
  - Documented on-boarding process allowing companies to both know where
    they can focus and what resources they need to invest in the WG
    (TBD)

Team feels starting a recruitment effort without the above being ready,
will not lead to desired results.

## Proposed Process (not listed in perfect order - this is a proposal)

  - SPDX current participants propose names of companies to invite to
    join SPDX WG
  - Ibrahim can help locate the right contacts if proposed companies are
    Linux Foundation members - right contacts are Legal Counsels working
    on open source, Director/VP open source, compliance officer, etc.
  - Set up a call with company + SPDX Reps + Ibrahim
  - Present SPDX pitch deck to the company (value proposition)
  - Get feedback
  - Keep email discussion ongoing and possibly enlarge the audience at
    target company
  - Invite company to next F2F or to call depending on interest
  - Keep email discussion ongoing and possibly enlarge the audience at
    target company
  - Keep contacts at company informed of new developments
  - Setup a F2F if it makes sense
  - Propose an SPDX seminar - deep dive style. We need to develop
    content for that purpose as part of on-boarding companies.
  - Identify road blocks for joining - work to resolve them (most likely
    they will come up with other companies as well)

## In parallel, we need to have

  - Strong event presence for education and promotion
  - Very usable web site
  - A way to capture interest on the web site (capture who downloads
    papers or spec for example and reach out to them)
  - 2.0 execution plan - detailed info on what's in 2.0, what needs to
    be done to get to a release point, etc.
