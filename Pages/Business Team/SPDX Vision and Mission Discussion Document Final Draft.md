### Proposed SPDX Vision Statement

“The vision of SPDX is to achieve license compliance with minimal cost
across the supply chain. Ideally, upstream component developers begin
the process by supplying SPDX files as part of their downloads. Users of
those components therefore have a starting point with the SPDX files
that they create for their "customers," and so on. If everything is
working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and
documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that
information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.”

### Proposed SPDX Mission Statement

"Develop and promote adoption of a specification to enable any party in
a software supply chain, from the original author to the final end user,
to accurately communicate the licensing information for any piece of
copyrightable material that such party may create, alter, combine, pass
on, or receive, and to make such information available in a consistent,
understandable, and re-usable fashion, with the aim of facilitating
license and other policy compliance."
