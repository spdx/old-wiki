# Overview

This document describes the SPDX Tool Certification program.

SPDX tools to cerify their implementations. At this time only the
required fields will be checked as part of the certifrication process.

Intial Roll Out Plan

# Certification Program

Want to look at license quality (how well they detect the licences in
code) vs how semantically correct they are(?). Will have a set of
reference packages with the right answers to compare to.

  - Is this a self certification or do we have to see the results?
  - Are there certifications for both producing and consuming?
  - Do you get a badge or something if you pass?

# Futures

  - Testing optional fields if used.
