  - Around 100 responses.
  - Punchline was that more than 75% thought it was important/very
    important to have a standard for exchanging license information.
  - Mostly technical/technical management types responded.
  - Good representation world wide.
  - Good mix of big and small companies.
  - Most of the people responding were NOT SPDX participants. How do we
    reach them?
  - Should we repeat survey at other events like LinuxCon or the
    Compliance Summit? Most of the responses we got were from cross
    posting to other lists and from the LF newsletter.
  - Website and talking with people seem to be the most important ways
    we are reaching people.
  - Seems to be uncertainty as to when this will be important, even
    though they believe it will.
  - There is a perceived complexity in this.
  - Next time we do a survey how do we better get the word out.
  - Summary attached to this page for the survey.
  - Should we do a newsletter or forum for people using SPDX?
