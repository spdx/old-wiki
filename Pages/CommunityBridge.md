# Community Bridge

These pages are dedicated to Community Bridge projects for SPDX.

## Summer 2020 Process and Selection Criteria

We now have funding and mentors available for up to 2 students. With
over 50 applications, we will need to be very selective.

Below is the process and the criteria we will use for selecting the
student for this project:

  - Applications are now open for any student with proof of enrollment
  - The project is scheduled to start July 1 and run through end of
    September
      - Since the project workload is equivalent to full-time work,
        applicants should make sure that no other obligations (e.g. to
        school) would prevent them for dedicating this time to their
        project
  - Applicants should upload a project proposal to community bridge with
    the following information before June 15:
      - A description of the project and how it improves the SPDX online
        tools and benefits the SPDX community
      - A workplan describing the deliverables
      - 4 specific milestones at 25% 50%, 75% and 100% of the project
        timeline â€“ these milestones will be basis for paying the student
        stipends throughout the project
  - Project ideas can be found on the Community Bridge Mentoring Project
    Ideas Page:
    <https://wiki.spdx.org/view/CommunityBridge/CommunityBridge_ProjectIdeas>
      - These reflect our current priorities, but are not restricting:
        we are open to any other project ideas applicants may propose
  - Selection will be based on 3 factors:
      - The project proposal
      - Contributions to any of the SPDX projects (all located under the
        SPDX GitHub organization): <https://github.com/spdx>
      - Contributions to other publicly available projects which use
        similar technologies (e.g. Python or Django projects)
  - A short list of candidates will be selected on the week of 15-19
    June
      - Applicants not selected will be notified, so that they are freed
        to apply to other Community Bridge projects
  - The final candidates will be selected on the week of 22-26 June
